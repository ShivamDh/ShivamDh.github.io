# Creating my own Website

I have created my own website using a multitude of languages and frameworks: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js.

React.js renders a single page website running client-side, however Github Pages did not allow for this.
As a result Gatsby.js was used to render a static webpage made from React and allow to be published on Github Pages.
