# My Website

Hi! Welcome to my personal website's repository. My website has been deployed and can be visited at shivamdh.github.io/

## How the website was made
I created the website using the JavaScript framework **React.js** along with **HTML** and **SASS/CSS** styling.

React allows fast and client-side renderings for single-page applications, along with seamless integration of 
third party libraries and features. This website also utilizes JavaScript libraries such as React-Bootstrap, and Material-UI
to go along with the SASS plugin for added features and styling. 

## My experience
My previous experience with React and JavaScript comes from multiple internships and work on Engineering design teams at university.
I have used React numerous times before, and am well-versed with the Flux architecture in general, for building small and large scale web applications.
