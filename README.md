# My Website

Hi! Welcome to my personal website's repository. My website has been deployed and can be visited at https://shivamdh.github.io/

## How the website was made
I created the website using a multitude of languages and frameworks including **HTML**, **SASS/CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **React.js**.

React allows fast and client-side renderings for single-page applcations, along with seamless integration of 
third party libraries and features. This website also utilizes React-Bootstrap, Material-UI and a SASS plugin
to add features and styling over the top. 


## My experience
My previous experience with React and JavaScript comes from my first internship in the summer of 2017. I was working as a Web Applications 
Developer and used React and Redux to build large scale web applications. Furthermore, I have also been involved in an Engineering Design
Team at my university and undertaken some independent projects upon my own time to learn more about web development.
