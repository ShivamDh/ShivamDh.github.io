# My Website

Hi! My website location has recently changed, it is now located at https://shivamdh.github.io/

Click [here](https://shivamdh.github.io/) to have a look at it!

## How the website was made
I created the website using a multitude of languages and frameworks including **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **React.js**.

React.js renders a single page website running client-side, however Github Pages did not allow for this.
As a result **Gatsby.js** was used to render a static webpage made from React and allow to be published on Github Pages.
