# My Website

Hi! My website location has recently changed, it is now located at https://shivamdh.github.io/ or click
[here](https://shivamdh.github.io/) to have a look at it!

## How the website was made
I created the website using a multitude of languages and frameworks including **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **React.js**.

React.js renders a single page website running client-side, however Github Pages did not allow for this.
As a result **Gatsby.js** was used to render a static webpage made from React and allow to be published on Github Pages.

## My experience
My previous experience with React and JavaScript comes from my involvement in an Engineering Design Team at my university,
having undertaken some independent projects upon my own time, and having utilized these languages and frameworks during my
first coop/internship
