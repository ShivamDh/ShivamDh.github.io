The *master* branch contains all the code for the webpage, orgnaized and easy to read.

The *gh-pages* branch contains Gatsby.js published code that will be difficult to follow.

I encourage you to look through the master branch if you would like to see my code.

## How the website was made
I created the website using a multitude of languages and frameworks including **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **React.js**.

React.js renders a single page website running client-side, however Github Pages did not allow for this.
As a result **Gatsby.js** was used to render a static webpage made from React and allow to be published on Github Pages.
