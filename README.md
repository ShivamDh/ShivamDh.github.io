# My Website

Hi there! My website location has changed! Previously, it was hosted on https://shivamdh.github.io/Personal-Website/
but from now on it has been moved to https://shivamdh.github.io

## How the website was made
I created the website using a multitude of languages and frameworks including **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **React.js**.

React.js renders a single page website running client-side, however Github Pages did not allow for this.
As a result **Gatsby.js** was used to render a static webpage made from React and allow to be published on Github Pages.
